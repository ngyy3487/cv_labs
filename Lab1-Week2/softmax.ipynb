Thus, at small values of $\\lambda$, the training accuracy will be very high and the testing accuracy will be very low as the model will closely fit the training data but not the test data. As $\\lambda$ increases, training accuracy decreases as the model will not fit the training set as well before. Testing accuracy will increase as the model will be more general, but after a certain point, $\\lambda$ = 1000 in the above graph, testing accuracy drops as the model becomes too general."
